Getting Started

Prerequisites:

    Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

Setting up the environment:

    Open the Anaconda Navigator, and click on Environments. Create a new environment, and choose Python 3.7 (rather than 3.8) in order to run TensorFlow. Then, within the new environment, install all of the following packages: tensorflow, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn. Finally, click back on home (still within the Anaconda Navigator) and install Jupyter Notebook.


Running:

	Open the project by launching Jupyter Notebook within the new environment using the Anaconda Navigator.
